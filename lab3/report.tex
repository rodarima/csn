\section{The metric}

For selecting the metric, I set the seed to the last 5 digits of my DNI, as 
recently seen in some hash generation\footnote{	
\url{http://klondike.es/klog/2017/09/25/descifrando-las-bases-de-datos-del-referendum-catalan/}}, 
and ran the following command in python:
%
\begin{pycode}
from random import *

seed(64718)
metrics = ["clustering coefficient", "closeness centrality"]
r = randint(0, 1)

print(metrics[r])
\end{pycode}
%
Which produced the following output
%
\begin{textcode}
% python metric.py
clustering coefficient
\end{textcode}
%
So I decided to use clustering coefficient $C_{WS}$ as a metric.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Cleaning the data}

The datasets have been uncompressed in \texttt{data/}, and then processed by the 
script \texttt{prepare-data.sh}, which removes the header with the number of 
nodes and edges, and outputs the remaining edge list in the same file with a new 
extension \texttt{.edges}. The properties of the graphs can be seen at the 
table~\ref{tab:prop}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{table1.tex}
	\caption{Properties of the graphs after preproccesing.}
	\label{tab:prop}
\end{table}

After some research I found the BiRewire R package \cite{birewire} written by A.  
Gobbi, a fast implementation of the switchin model \cite{gobbi14} 
\cite{gobbi17}.

\section{Proposition}

Based on some properties of a graph $\hat G$, we want to create a sequence of 
random graphs $\langle G \rangle$ by using two different methods, and then test 
if they maintain a set of measures that we found on $\hat G$.

The first model, the Erdös--Rényi graph takes as input the number of vertex 
$|V|$ and edges $|E|$ of $\hat G$, and builds a new random graph with the same 
number of vertex and edges. The clustering coefficient is then computed for each 
graph in the sequence $\langle G \rangle$ as $\langle X \rangle$.

We can consider the measurement $X$ as a random variable, with mean $E[X]$ and 
variance $VAR[X]$. By computing $T$ elements in the sequence, the sample mean 
$\overline X$ is an unbiased estimator of $E[X]$, and by the central limit 
theorem, the sample $\overline X$ is distributed 

\subsection{Erdös--Rényi model}

The ER model is implemented in \texttt{python} using the \texttt{networkx} 
package.  The \texttt{gnm\_random\_graph} creates a ER graph with parameters 
$|V|$ and $|E|$. An average of $T = 25$ graphs is performed. The measure is 
taken by calling \texttt{average\_clustering}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{table2.tex}
	\caption{The measures of ER model.}
	\label{tab:er}
\end{table}
%
We see that none of the generated graphs contain a value greater that the 
original one. We can conclude that, even the ER model keeps the number of nodes 
and edges, the clustering coefficient is smaller.
